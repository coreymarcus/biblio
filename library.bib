abstract = {In this paper, a new version of the quadrature Kalman filter (QKF) is developed theoretically and tested experimentally. We first derive the new QKF for nonlinear systems with additive Gaussian noise by linearizing the process and measurement functions using statistical linear regression (SLR) through a set of Gauss-Hermite quadrature points that parameterize the Gaussian density. Moreover, we discuss how the new QKF can be extended and modified to take into account specific details of a given application. We then go on to extend the use of the new QKF to discrete-time, nonlinear systems with additive, possibly non-Gaussian noise. A bank of parallel QKFs, called the Gaussian sum-quadrature Kalman filter (GS-QKF) approximates the predicted and posterior densities as a finite number of weighted sums of Gaussian densities. The weights are obtained from the residuals of the QKFs. Three different Gaussian mixture reduction techniques are presented to alleviate the growing number of the Gaussian sum terms inherent to the GS-QKFs. Simulation results exhibit a significant improvement of the GS-QKFs over other nonlinear filtering approaches, namely, the basic bootstrap (particle) filters and Gaussian-sum extended Kalman filters, to solve nonlinear non- Gaussian filtering problems. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {As a core robotic and vision problem, camera and range sensor calibration have been researched intensely over the last decades. However, robotic research efforts still often get heavily delayed by the requirement of setting up a calibrated system consisting of multiple cameras and range measurement units. With regard to removing this burden, we present a toolbox with web interface for fully automatic camera-to-camera and camera-to-range calibration. Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities. Experiments using a variety of sensors such as grayscale and color cameras, the Kinect 3D sensor and the Velodyne HDL-64 laser scanner show the robustness of our method in different indoor and outdoor settings and under various lighting conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new nonlinear filter for high-dimensional state estimation, which we have named the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). The heart of the CKF is a spherical-radial cubature rule, which makes it possible to numerically compute multivariate moment integrals encountered in the nonlinear Bayesian filter. Specifically, we derive a third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule that provides a set of cubature points scaling linearly with the state-vector dimension. The CKF may therefore provide a systematic solution for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems. The paper also includes the derivation of a square-root version of the CKF for improved numerical stability. The CKF is tested experimentally in two nonlinear state estimation problems. In the first problem, the proposed cubature rule is used to compute the second-order statistics of a nonlinearly transformed Gaussian random variable. The second problem addresses the use of the CKF for tracking a maneuvering aircraft. The results of both experiments demonstrate the improved performance of the CKF over conventional nonlinear filters. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

Such a VTVL vehicle would take off vertically under rocket propulsion, translate a specified horizontal distance, and vertically return softly to the surface. Previous literature suggested that the propellant required to perform such a maneuver could be estimated via an impulsive-ballistic trajectory using the “ideal” rocket equation. This analysis was found to be inadequate. Any feasible trajectories will always require additional propellant to compensate for gravity losses while lifting off and landing. Additionally, there is an asymmetry between the takeoff and landing phases of the maneuver due to the propellant mass used over the course of the flight. Lastly, various potential spacecraft propulsion system architectures impose a number of possible constraints on the allowable path and boundary conditions.},

abstract = {A dynamic model is the usual modus operandi of a Mobile Mapping System. The model solution, after linearization and discretization, is achieved using the Weighted Least-Squares (WLS) approach, which results in one of the various Kalman filter algorithms. However, implicit in the formulation is that neither the observation equation matrices nor the transition matrices at any epoch contain random entries. As such an assumption cannot always be guaranteed, we here allow random observational errors to enter the respective matrices. We replace the WLS by the Total-Least-Squares (TLS) principle - with or without weights - and apply it to this novel Dynamic Errors-in-Variables (DEIV) model, which results in what we call Total Kalman Filter (TKF). It promises to offer more representative solutions to the dynamic models of Mobile Mapping Systems over existing versions of Kalman filtering.},

This approach utilizes previously developed techniques for detecting hazard objects from images and an Extended Kalman Filter recursive estimation framework in order to create an occupancy grid representation of the hazards in the landing area. The guidance augmentation is driven by a model-predictive scheme which uses predictions of map entropy and fuel usage in order to generate information-seeking acceleration commands which are combined with the targeting capability of Modified Apollo Guidance. An overview of the algorithmic steps required to adjust the trajectory and predict mapping performance and fuel costs are presented.

abstract = {This paper reports on a fast multiresolution scan matcher for vehicle localization in urban environments for self-driving cars. State-of-the-art approaches to vehicle localization rely on observing road surface reflectivity with a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. However, these approaches can often fail when faced with adverse weather conditions that obscure the view of the road paint (e.g., puddles and snowdrifts) or poor road surface texture. We propose a new scan matching algorithm that leverages Gaussian mixture maps to exploit the structure in the environment; these maps are a collection of Gaussian mixtures over the z-height distribution. We achieve real-time performance by developing a novel branch-and-bound, multiresolution approach that makes use of rasterized lookup tables of these Gaussian mixtures. Results are shown on two datasets that are 3.0 km: A standard trajectory and another under adverse weather conditions.},

@article{Iiyama2021,
abstract = {This research proposes a new integrated framework for identifying safe landing locations and planning in-flight divert maneuvers. The state-of-the-art algorithms for landing zone selection utilize local terrain features such as slopes and roughness to judge the safety and priority of the landing point. However, when there are additional chances of observation and diverting in the future, these algorithms are not able to evaluate the safety of the decision itself to target the selected landing point considering the overall descent trajectory. In response to this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes a landing site selection strategy concurrently with a guidance and control strategy to the target landing site. The trained agent could evaluate and select landing sites with explicit consideration of the terrain features, quality of future observations, and control to achieve a safe and efficient landing trajectory at a system-level. The proposed framework was able to achieve 94.8 $\%$ of successful landing in highly challenging landing sites where over 80$\%$ of the area around the initial target lading point is hazardous, by effectively updating the target landing site and feedback control gain during descent.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) suitable for efficient bathy- metric mapping that does not require explicit identification, tracking, or association of seafloor features. This is accomplished using a Rao–Blackwellized particle filter, in which each particle maintains a hypothesis of the current vehicle state and a grid-based, two-dimensional depth map, efficiently stored by exploiting redundan- cies between different maps. Distributed particle mapping is employed to remove the computational expense of map copying during the resampling process. The proposed approach to bathymetric SLAM is validated us- ing multibeam sonar data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle over a small-timescale mission (2 h) and a remotely operated vehicle over a large-timescale mission (11 h). The results demonstrate how obser- vations of the seafloor structure improve the estimated trajectory and resulting map when compared to dead reckoning fused with ultrashort-baseline or long-baseline observations. The consistency and robustness of this approach to common errors in navigation is also explored. Furthermore, results are compared with a preexist- ing state-of-the art bathymetric SLAM technique, confirming that similar results can be achieved at a fraction of the computation cost.},

abstract = {Planetary soft landing is one of the benchmark problems of optimal control theory and is gaining renewed interest due to the increased focus on the exploration of planets in the solar system, such as Mars. The soft landing problem with all relevant constraints can be posed as a finite-horizon optimal control problem with state and control constraints. The real-time generation of fuel-optimal paths to a prescribed location on a planet's surface is a challenging problem due to the constraints on the fuel, the control inputs, and the states. The main difficulty in solving this constrained problem is the existence of nonconvex constraints on the control input, which are due to a nonzero lower bound on the control input magnitude and a nonconvex constraint on its direction. This paper introduces a convexification of the control constraints that is proven to be lossless; i.e., an optimal solution of the soft landing problem can be obtained via solution of the proposed convex relaxation of the problem. The lossless convexification enables the use of interior point methods of convex optimization to obtain optimal solutions of the original nonconvex optimal control problem.},

Gaussian mixture models are employed to capture these structural dependencies and learn a semiparametric, arbitrary resolution spatial representation. A hierarchy of spatial models is proposed to enable a multifidelity representation with the variation in fidelity quantified via information-Theoretic measures. Crucially for active perception, the proposed modeling approach enables a distribution over occupancy with an associated measure of uncertainty via incorporation of free space information. Evaluation of the proposed technique via a real-Time graphics processing unit based implementation is presented on real-world data sets in diverse environments. The proposed approach is shown to perform favorably as compared to state-of-The-Art occupancy mapping techniques in terms of memory footprint, prediction accuracy, and generalizability to structurally diverse environments.},

The proposed method aims at saving the computational memory in the grid-based RBPF-SLAM while maintaining the mapping accuracy. Unlike conventional RBPF-SLAM in which each particle has its own map of the whole environment, each particle has only a small map of the nearby environment called an individual map in the proposed method. Instead, the map of the remaining large environment is shared by the particles. The part shared by the particles is called a base map. If the individual small maps become reliable enough to trust, they are merged with the base map. To determine when and which part of an individual map should be merged with the base map, we propose two map sharing criteria. Finally, the proposed IPMS RBPF-SLAM is applied to the real-world datasets and benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our method outperforms conventional methods in terms of map accuracy versus memory consumption.},

However, most drone navigation methods rely on global positioning system (GPS) signals. When GPS signals are missing, these drones cannot land or recover properly. In fact, with the help of optical equipment and image recognition technology, the position and posture of the drone in three dimensions can be obtained, and the environment where the drone is located can be perceived. This paper proposes and implements a monocular vision-based drone autonomous landing system in emergencies and in unstructured environments. In this system, a novel map representation approach is proposed that combines three-dimensional features and a mid-pass filter to remove noise and construct a grid map with different heights. In addition, a region segmentation is presented to detect the edges of different-height grid areas for the sake of improving the speed and accuracy of the subsequent landing area selection. As a visual landing technology, this paper evaluates the proposed algorithm in two tasks: scene reconstruction integrity and landing location security. In these tasks, firstly, a drone scans the scene and acquires key frames in the monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system in order to estimate the pose of the drone and to create a three-dimensional point cloud map. Then, the filtered three-dimensional point cloud map is converted into a grid map. The grid map is further divided into different regions to select the appropriate landing zone. Thus, it can carry out autonomous route planning. Finally, when it stops upon the landing field, it will start the descent mode near the landing area. Experiments in multiple sets of real scenes show that the environmental awareness and the landing area selection have high robustness and real-time performance.},

In particular, first we introduce a new methodology for determining the unobservable directions of nonlinear systems by factorizing the observability matrix according to the observable and unobservable modes. Subsequently, we apply this method to the VINS nonlinear model and determine its unobservable directions analytically. We leverage our analysis to improve the accuracy and consistency of linearized estimators applied to VINS. Our key findings are evaluated through extensive simulations and experimental validation on real-world data, demonstrating the superior accuracy and consistency of the proposed VINS framework compared to standard approaches. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {A new Gaussian mixture filter has been developed, one that uses a resampling step in order to limit the covariances of its individual Gaussian components. The new filter has been designed to produce accurate solutions of difficult nonlinear/non-Gaussian estimation problems. It uses static multiple-model filter calculations and extended Kalman filter (EKF) approximations for each Gaussian mixand in order to perform dynamic propagation and measurement update. The resampling step uses a newly designed algorithm that employs matrix inequalities in order to bound each mixand's covariance. Resampling occurs between the dynamic propagation and the measurement update in order to ensure bounded covariance in both of these operations. The resampling algorithm also attempts to economize on the number of new mixands. The resulting filter has been tested on a difficult seven-state nonlinear filtering problem. It achieves significantly better accuracy than a simple EKF, an unscented Kalman filter, a moving-horizon estimator/backwards-smoothing EKF, and a regularized particle filter.},

It applies to scenarios such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance and reconnaissance, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A multi-sensor active information acquisition problem, capturing the common characteristics of these scenarios, is formulated. The goal is to design sensor control policies which minimize the entropy of the estimation task, conditioned on the future measurements. First, we provide a non-greedy centralized solution, which is computationally fast, since it exploits linearized sensing models, and memory efficient, since it exploits sparsity in the environment model. Next, we decentralize the control task to obtain linear complexity in the number of sensors and provide suboptimality guarantees. Finally, our algorithms are applied to the multi-robot active SLAM problem to enable a decentralized nonmyopic solution that exploits sparsity in the planning process.},

This study also pointed out the outcomes that could possibly contribute to the key lunar questions on the basis of the selected landing sites of CE-4 and CE-5 such as deep material in South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, lunar chronology, volcanic thermodynamics and geological structure evolution history of the Moon. Finally, this approach analyzed the development trend of China's follow-up lunar landing missions, and suggested that the South Pole Region of the Moon could be the landing site of high priority for the future CE missions.},

Many variants of ICP have been proposed, affecting all phases of the algorithm from the se- lection and matching of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces, we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.},

abstract = {Many important geometric estimation problems naturally take the form of synchronization over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of unknown group elements x1,....,xn ϵ SE(d) given noisy measurements of a subset of their pairwise relative transforms x -1i x j . Examples of this class include the foundational problems of pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) (in robotics), camera motion estimation (in computer vision), and sensor network localization (in distributed sensing), among others. This inference problem is typically formulated as a non-convex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) whose minimizer provides an exact maximum-likelihood estimate so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semidefinite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem defined on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync is capable of recovering certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so significantly faster than the Gauss–Newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {This paper describes some of the environmental challenges associated with landing a crewed or robotic vehicle at any certified location on the lunar surface (i.e. not a mountain peak, permanently dark crater or steep terrain), with a specific focus on how hazard detection technology may be incorporated to mitigate such challenges. For this discussion, the vehicle of interest is the Altair Lunar Lander, being the system element of the NASA Constellation Program aimed at returning humans to the moon. Lunar environmental challenges for such global lunar access primarily involve terrain and lighting. These would include sizable rocks and slopes, which are more concentrated in highland areas; small craters, which are essentially everywhere independent of terrain type; and for polar regions, low-angle sunlight, which leaves significant terrain in shadow. To address these issues, as well as to provide for precision landing, the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) Project was charted by NASA Headquarters, and has since been making significant progress. That progress has included the ALHAT team's consideration of several sensors for real-time hazard detection, settling on the use of a Flash Lidar mounted to a high-speed gimbal, utilizing state-of-the-art image processing and elevation interpretation software. The Altair Project has been working with the ALHAT team to understand the capabilities and limitations of the ALHAT concept, and has incorporated much of the ALHAT hazard detection system into the Altair baseline design. This integration, along with open issues relating to computational performance, the need for system redundancy, and potential pilot interaction, will be explored further in this paper.},

abstract = {Traditional feature matching methods such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) usually use image intensity or gradient information to detect and describe feature points; however, both intensity and gradient are sensitive to nonlinear radiation distortions (NRD). To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel feature matching algorithm that is robust to large NRD. The proposed method is called radiation-invariant feature transform (RIFT). There are three main contributions in RIFT: first, RIFT uses phase congruency (PC) instead of image intensity for feature point detection. RIFT considers both the number and repeatability of feature points, and detects both corner points and edge points on the PC map. Second, RIFT originally proposes a maximum index map (MIM) for feature description. MIM is constructed from the log-Gabor convolution sequence and is much more robust to NRD than traditional gradient map. Thus, RIFT not only largely improves the stability of feature detection, but also overcomes the limitation of gradient information for feature description. Third, RIFT analyzes the inherent influence of rotations on the values of MIM, and realizes rotation invariance. We use six different types of multi-model image datasets to evaluate RIFT, including optical-optical, infrared-optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical, depth-optical, map-optical, and day-night datasets. Experimental results show that RIFT is much more superior to SIFT and SAR-SIFT. To the best of our knowledge, RIFT is the first feature matching algorithm that can achieve good performance on all the above-mentioned types of multi-model images. The source code of RIFT and multi-modal remote sensing image datasets are made public1.},

abstract = {We propose a fundamentally novel approach to real-time visual odometry for a monocular camera. It allows to benefit from the simplicity and accuracy of dense tracking-which does not depend on visual features-while running in real-time on a CPU. The key idea is to continuously estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, which in turn is used to track the motion of the camera using dense image alignment. More specifically, we estimate the depth of all pixels which have a non-negligible image gradient. Each estimate is represented as a Gaussian probability distribution over the inverse depth. We propagate this information over time, and update it with new measurements as new images arrive. In terms of tracking accuracy and computational speed, the proposed method compares favorably to both state-of-the-art dense and feature-based visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. As our method runs in real-time on a CPU, it is of large practical value for robotics and augmented reality applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-vehicle decentralized SLAM algorithm. We expose the different problems involved by this decentralized setting, such as network aspects (data losses, latencies or bandwidth requirements) or data incest (double-counting information), and address them. In order to ease the data association process and also guarantee the consistency of the vehicles localizations, we introduce a new model to represent the natural drift affecting SLAM algorithms. By integrating this model, loop closures, associations between robots and absolute information can be easily taken into account. A general framework has been designed thus allowing to use any SLAM algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we applied it to a monocular solution. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that a monocular decentralized SLAM is presented. A multi-robot data association algorithm, based on geometric constraints is also exposed in this paper. The validation is performed thanks to a simulator presenting a realistic physics. The results show that the localizations consistency is preserved. It also demonstrates that multi-vehicle monocular SLAM is viable in urban environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 ISIF ( Intl Society of Information Fusi.},

Although filter-based monocular SLAM systems were common at some time, the more efficient keyframe-based solutions are becoming the de facto methodology for building a monocular SLAM system. The objective of this paper is threefold: first, the paper serves as a guideline for people seeking to design their own monocular SLAM according to specific environmental constraints. Second, it presents a survey that covers the various keyframe-based monocular SLAM systems in the literature, detailing the components of their implementation, and critically assessing the specific strategies made in each proposed solution. Third, the paper provides insight into the direction of future research in this field, to address the major limitations still facing monocular SLAM; namely, in the issues of illumination changes, initialization, highly dynamic motion, poorly textured scenes, repetitive textures, map maintenance, and failure recovery.},

The index includes not only factors like safety of the terrain in view and terminal motion state, but also the maneuverability of the vehicle.

The online selection and transfer process ensures the safety of the landing mission from multiple aspects. Further Monte Carlo simulations show the effectiveness and robustness of the scheme.},

Reference trajectory guidance methods employing analog computing used for ballistic missiles in the 1950s were not suitable for new space launch vehicles like the Saturn V. The advent of flyable digital computers permitted the development of software-based guidance algorithms. IGM was inspired by Derek Lawden's linear tangent steering law. IGM was controversial due to the use of multiple simplifying assumptions and the iterative nature of the algorithm. A non-iterative solution to the guidance problem could not be obtained. Chandler protected her team from internal politics and the vigorous debate surrounding Saturn guidance. She encouraged them to innovate and explore new ideas, regardless of the strong opinions of engineers and management in other organizations at Marshall. Closed loop guidance using digital computing was a new idea and there were no courses, books, or papers on the topic for her team to learn from.},

Several different hierarchical merging methods are proposed for different cluster concepts, based on the ridgeline analysis of modality of Gaussian mixtures, the dip test, the Bhattacharyya dissimilarity, a direct estimator of misclassification and the strength of predicting pairwise cluster memberships.

The nonstationary case is derived directly from the associated unconstrained total least-squares loss function. The stationary case is derived by using a linear expansion of the total least-squares estimate equation, which involves a first-order expansion of the associated singular value decomposition matrices. The actual solution for the error covariance is evaluated at the true variables, which are unknown in practice. Two common approaches to overcome this difficulty are used; the first involves using the measurements directly and the second involves using the estimates, which are more accurate than the measurements. This paper shows that using the latter greatly simplifies the errorcovariance solution for the stationary case.

With the motivation of decreasing production costs, successful vertical rocket landing attempts by SpaceX and Blue Origin have led the path for autonomous recovery and reusability of rocket engines. Such a feat can only be accomplished by complex control algorithms executing in real-time aboard the rocket. This project aims to develop a vertical rocket landing simulation environment where algorithms based on classical control and machine learning can be designed and evaluated. After developing the simulated environment in Python using a robust physics engine known as Box2D, two control algorithms were designed; once classical control method and the other from the optimal control domain. The classical control Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller served as a benchmark, whereas Model Predictive Control (MPC) makes use of an optimizer to find the best performing action to take based on an objective function. Two Reinforcement Learning algorithms were then designed with the aim of automatically developing the required control without explicitly defining the dynamics of the system. These methods, known formally as Function Approximation Q- Learning and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) provided a contrasting approach to the PID and MPC controllers. While the classical controllers achieve acceptable performance, the Artificial Intelligent counterparts, specifically the DDPG to a more stable and consistent rocket landing.},

While the particle filter is fairly easy to implement and tune, its main drawback is that it is quite computer intensive, with the computational complexity increasing quickly with the state dimension. One remedy to this problem is to marginalize out the states appearing linearly in the dynamics. The result is that one Kalman filter is associated with each particle. The main contribution in this paper is the derivation of the details for the marginalized particle filter for a general nonlinear state-space model. Several important special cases occurring in typical signal processing applications will also be discussed. The marginalized particle filter is applied to an integrated navigation system for aircraft. It is demonstrated that the complete high-dimensional system can be based on a particle filter using marginalization for all but three states.

Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to in-corporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on an ex-act factorization of the posterior into a product of con-ditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far be-yond the reach of previous approaches.

When using the current state of the art of two-dimensional optical images for relative navigation, an iteration process occurs between the optical navigation image correlation and orbit determination that typically must be performed on the ground. This paper presents a feasible measurement alternative to optical navigation that removes this iteration process and therefore adds potential to performing orbit determination onboard the spacecraft, increasing its navigation autonomy.

It concurrently estimates the depth at these pixels from two types of stereo cues: Static stereo through the fixed-baseline stereo camera setup as well as temporal multi-view stereo exploiting the camera motion. By incorporating both disparity sources, our algorithm can even estimate depth of pixels that are under-constrained when only using fixed-baseline stereo. Using a fixed baseline, on the other hand, avoids scale-drift that typically occurs in pure monocular SLAM.We furthermore propose a robust approach to enforce illumination invariance, capable of handling aggressive brightness changes between frames – greatly improving the performance in realistic settings.

abstract = {Effective porosity is that portion of the total void space of a porous material that is capable of transmitting a fluid. Total porosity is the ratio of the total void volume to the total bulk volume. Porosity ratios traditionally are multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percent. Effective porosity occurs because a fluid in a saturated porous media will not flow through all voids, but only through the voids which are interconnected. Unconnected pores are often called dead-end pores. Particle size, shape, and packing arrangement are among the factors that determine the occurance of dead-end pores. In addition, some fluid contained in interconnected pores is held in place by molecular and surface-tension forces. This "immobile" fluid volume also does not participate in fluid flow. Increased attention is being given to the effectiveness of fine grain materials as a retardant to flow. The calculation of travel time (t) of contaminants through fine grain materials, considering advection only, requires knowledge of effective porosity (ne): where x is the distance travelled, K is the hydraulic conductivity, and I is the hydraulic gradient. The lack of a reliable method for determining effective porosity has necessitated the estimation of this parameter. Currently, this is an undesirable but unavoidable practice. Effective porosity is an important parameter in calculation of contaminant transport. This study documents laboratory technique for measuring effective porosity of fine-grained soils. Confusion about the meaning of effective porosity and its relation to total porosity also is explained. (1) This project is of benefit to ground-water professionals who are involved in prevention and mitigation of contamination. Planners and regulators involved in ground water pollution prevention strategies and regulation also will have more definitive data on which appropriate decisions can be made. Relationships identified between effective porosity and physical characteristics may permit estimation of the importance and magnitude of effective porosity from the total porosity and physical characteristics without its direct measurement. The review of work in associated sciences is an important starting point for research in fine-grain saturated soils.},

abstract = {Robust, scalable place recognition is a core competency for many robotic applications. However, when revisiting places over and over, many state-of-the-art approaches exhibit reduced performance in terms of computation and memory complexity and in terms of accuracy. For successful deployment of robots over long time scales, we must develop algorithms that get better with repeated visits to the same environment, while still working within a fixed computational budget. This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that alternates between online place recognition and offline map maintenance with the goal of producing the best performance with a fixed map size. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map, we use a scoring function that ranks the utility of each landmark and a sampling policy that selects the landmarks for each place. The Summary Map can then be used by any descriptor-based inference method for constant-complexity online place recognition.

abstract = {Having been referred to as the Holy Grail of autonomous robotics research, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) lies at the core of most the autonomous robotic applications [1]. This article explains the recent advances in the representations of robotic sensor measurements and the map itself as well as their consequences on the robustness of SLAM. Fundamentally, the concept of a set-based measurement and map state representation allows all of the measurement information, spatial and detection, to be incorporated into joint Bayesian SLAM frameworks. Modeling measurements and the map state as random finite sets (RFSs) rather than the traditionally adopted random vectors is not merely a triviality of notation. It will be demonstrated that a set-based framework circumvents the necessity for any fragile data association and map management heuristics, which are necessary in vectorbased solutions. {\textcopyright} 1994-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {We discuss the problem of inspecting an underwater structure, such as a submerged ship hull, with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Unlike a large body of prior work, we focus on planning the views of the AUV to improve the quality of the inspection, rather than maximizing the accuracy of a given data stream. We formulate the inspection planning problem as an extension to Bayesian active learning, and we show connections to recent theoretical guarantees in this area. We rigorously analyze the benefit of adaptive re-planning for such problems, and we prove that the potential benefit of adaptivity can be reduced from an exponential to a constant factor by changing the problem from cost minimization with a constraint on information gain to variance reduction with a constraint on cost. Such analysis allows the use of robust, non-adaptive planning algorithms that perform competitively with adaptive algorithms. Based on our analysis, we propose a method for constructing 3D meshes from sonar-derived point clouds, and we introduce uncertainty modeling through non-parametric Bayesian regression. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of active inspection planning using sonar data from ship hull inspections with the Bluefin-MIT Hovering AUV. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

Unlike conventional feature-based visual and LiDAR mapping, the proposed approach is direct, eliminating the visual feature in the objective function. We evaluated results using our portable camera-LiDAR system as well as KITTI odometry benchmark datasets. The experimental results prove that the characteristics of two complementary sensors are very effective in improving real-time performance and accuracy.

The free-flying vehicle is the Masten Space Systems Xombie vertical-takeoff, vertical-landing suborbital rocket. A specific technology ADAPT is demonstrating in the near-term is Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Diverts (G-FOLD), a fuel-optimal trajectory planner for diverts during powered descent, which is the final kilometers of descent to landing on rocket engines. Previously, ADAPT used Xombie to fly optimal large-divert trajectories, extending Xombie's divert range to 750 m. However, these trajectories were planned off-line with G-FOLD. This paper reports the successful Xombie flight demonstrations of large diverts using G-FOLD on board to calculate divert trajectories in real time while descending. The culminant test flight of the last year was an 800 m divert that was initiated at an altitude of 290 m while moving away from and crosswise to the landing pad. Hence, G-FOLD had to calculate a constrained divert trajectory that reversed direction, was fully three-dimensional, with horizontal motion nearly three times the initial altitude, and it did so in $\sim$100 ms on board Xombie as it was descending. Xombie then flew the divert trajectory with meter-level precision, demonstrating that G-FOLD had planned a trajectory respecting all the constraints of the rocket-powered vehicle. The steps to reach this flight demonstration of on-board generation of optimal divert trajectories and the system engineering for future ADAPT payloads are also presented.},

abstract = {Matching 2D range scans is a basic component of many localization and mapping algorithms. Most scan match algorithms require finding correspondences between the used features, i.e. points or lines. We propose an alternative representation for a range scan, the Normal Distributions Transform. Similar to an occupancy grid, we subdivide the 2D plane into cells. To each cell, we assign a normal distribution, which locally models the probability of measuring a point. The result of the transform is a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density, that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm. Thereby, no explicit correspondences have to be established. We present the algorithm in detail and show the application to relative position tracking and simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM). First results on real data demonstrate, that the algorithm is capable to map unmodified indoor environments reliable and in real time, even without using odometry data (see video).},

abstract = {We propose a fundamentally novel approach to real-time visual odometry for a monocular camera. It allows to benefit from the simplicity and accuracy of dense tracking-which does not depend on visual features-while running in real-time on a CPU. The key idea is to continuously estimate a semi-dense inverse depth map for the current frame, which in turn is used to track the motion of the camera using dense image alignment. More specifically, we estimate the depth of all pixels which have a non-negligible image gradient. Each estimate is represented as a Gaussian probability distribution over the inverse depth. We propagate this information over time, and update it with new measurements as new images arrive. In terms of tracking accuracy and computational speed, the proposed method compares favorably to both state-of-the-art dense and feature-based visual odometry and SLAM algorithms. As our method runs in real-time on a CPU, it is of large practical value for robotics and augmented reality applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The proposed algorithm is designed aiming to reduce the computational effort typically required to process highly dense LIDAR point cloud data for the generation of a hazard map. In this respect, the proposed logic consists in selecting the safest landing region by diving the hazard detection process in two phases. First, a coarse hazard map is generated to discard most of the dangerous regions of terrain from the selection process. Second, a fine hazard map is generated over the safe areas to identify the best landing spot. The level of hazard is measured taking the local surface slope, height, and roughness into account. Preliminary performance assessment of the proposed technique is carried out using point clouds acquired imaging a mockup of the Lunar terrain with the RVS3000-3D{\textregistered} scanning LIDAR (developed by Jena Optronik GmbH). In addition, the algorithm is tested processing a high-density terrestrial DEM, available through the Open Topography website, to evaluate its performance against a realistic landing terrain scenario.},

abstract = {The vast amount of data robots can capture today motivates the development of fast and scalable statistical tools to model the space the robot operates in. We devise a new technique for environment representation through continuous occupancy mapping that improves on the popular occupancy grip maps in two fundamental aspects: (1) it does not assume an a priori discrimination of the world into grid cells and therefore can provide maps at an arbitrary resolution; (2) it captures spatial relationships between measurements naturally, thus being more robust to outliers and possessing better generalization performance. The technique, named Hilbert maps, is based on the computation of fast kernel approximations that project the data in a Hilbert space where a logistic regression classifier is learnt. We show that this approach allows for efficient stochastic gradient optimization where each measurement is only processed once during learning in an online manner. We present results with three types of approximations: random Fourier; Nystr{\"{o}}m; and a novel sparse projection. We also extend the approach to accept probability distributions as inputs, for example, due to uncertainty over the position of laser scans due to sensor or localization errors. In this extended version, experiments were conducted in two dimensions and three dimensions, using popular benchmark datasets. Furthermore, an analysis of the adaptive capabilities of the technique to handle large changes in the data, such as trajectory update before and after loop closure during simultaneous localization and mapping, is also included.},

In particular, the proposed LIC-Fusion performs online spatial and temporal sensor calibration between all three asynchronous sensors, in order to compensate for possible calibration variations. The key contribution is the optimal (up to linearization errors) multi-modal sensor fusion of detected and tracked sparse edge/surf feature points from LiDAR scans within an efficient MSCKF-based framework, alongside sparse visual feature observations and IMU readings. We perform extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, showing that the proposed LIC-Fusion outperforms the state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and LiDAR odometry methods in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness to aggressive motions.},

abstract = {We introduce a new statistical modelling technique for building occupancy maps. The problem of mapping is addressed as a classification task where the robot's environment is classified into regions of occupancy and free space. This is obtained by employing a modified Gaussian process as a non-parametric Bayesian learning technique to exploit the fact that real-world environments inherently possess structure. This structure introduces dependencies between points on the map which are not accounted for by many common mapping techniques such as occupancy grids. Our approach is an 'anytime' algorithm that is capable of generating accurate representations of large environments at arbitrary resolutions to suit many applications. It also provides inferences with associated variances into occluded regions and between sensor beams, even with relatively few observations. Crucially, the technique can handle noisy data, potentially from multiple sources, and fuse it into a robust common probabilistic representation of the robot's surroundings. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on simulated datasets with known ground truth and in outdoor urban environments. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2011.},

In this paper, we propose for the first time a direct, tightly-coupled formulation for the combination of visual and inertial data. Our algorithm runs in real-time on a standard CPU. The processing is split in three threads. The first thread runs at frame rate and estimates the camera motion by a joint non-linear optimization from visual and inertial data given a semidense map. The second one creates a semidense map of high-gradient areas only for camera tracking purposes. Finally, the third thread estimates a fully dense reconstruction of the scene at a lower frame rate. We have evaluated our algorithm in several real sequences with ground truth trajectory data, showing a state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a tractable solution to feature-based (FB) SLAM in the presence of data association uncertainty and uncertainty in the number of features. By modeling the feature map as a random finite set (RFS), a rigorous Bayesian formulation of the FB-SLAM problem that accounts for uncertainty in the number of features and data association is presented. As such, the joint posterior distribution of the set-valued map and vehicle trajectory is propagated forward in time as measurements arrive. A first order solution, coined the PHD-SLAM filter, is derived, which jointly propagates the posterior PHD or intensity function of the map and the posterior distribution of the trajectory of the vehicle. A Rao-Blackwellised implementation of the PHD-SLAM filter is proposed based on the Gaussian mixture PHD filter for the map and a particle filter for the vehicle trajectory. Simulated results demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach, particularly in situations of high clutter and data association ambiguity. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 AACC. Challenging control problems are ubiquitous in aerospace engineering applications. Such applications include reusable rockets, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, satellite constellation management for terrestrial imaging, and many other ones where vehicles are required to perform reliably while adhering to physical and mission constraints. Physical constraints are due to limitations like finite fuel, whereas mission constraints can arise from sensor pointing requirements or safety keep-out zones. Often, mission success necessitates that these constraints be satisfied in real-time, using limited on-board computational resources. In this paper, we present a tutorial on how to formulate some aerospace control problem examples in an optimization based control framework. Specifically, we decompose the control problem into two levels: guidance (trajectory optimization), and feedback control. In guidance, we use recent convexification results to formulate non-convex trajectory optimization problems as finite-dimensional convex optimization problems, which we solve using fast and reliable Interior Point Method (IPM) algorithms. We discuss the current state of the art of convexification techniques, and outline the context in which these techniques should be used. Lastly, we present an overview of synthesis methods for feedback control laws. These control laws are used to track the guidance trajectories within specified error bounds, and in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances.},

Accordingly, a key issue is to reduce the number of particles and/or to make use of compact map representations. This paper presents an approximative but highly efficient approach to mapping with Rao-Blackwellized particle filters. Moreover, it provides a compact map model. A key advantage is that the individual particles can share large parts of the model of the environment. Furthermore, they are able to reuse an already computed proposal distribution. Both techniques substantially speed up the overall filtering process and reduce the memory requirements.

Scene segmentation and shape recognition in a single image must be carefully designed to achieve robust object detection and to facilitate object pose estimation. We describe a novel multi-feature object detection algorithm conceived to find human-made artefacts lying on the seabed. The proposed method searches for a target object according to a few general criteria that are robust to the underwater context, such as salient colour uniformity and sharp contours. We assess the performance of the proposed algorithm across different underwater datasets. The datasets have been obtained using stereo cameras of different quality, and diverge for the target object type and colour, acquisition depth and conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been experimentally demonstrated. Finally, object detection is discussed in connection with the simple colour-based segmentation and with the difficulty of tri-dimensional processing on noisy data.},

The corresponding features in the camera image are obtained from the camera's extrinsic matrix. We explain the reasons behind selecting these features, and why they are more robust compared to other possibilities. To obtain the optimal extrinsic parameters, we choose a genetic algorithm to address the highly non-linear state space. The process is automated after defining the bounds of the 3D experimental region relative to the lidar, and the true board dimensions. In addition, the camera is assumed to be intrinsically calibrated. Our method requires a minimum of 3 checkerboard poses, and the calibration accuracy is demonstrated by evaluating our algorithm using real world and simulated features.},

abstract = {This paper presents ORB-SLAM, a feature-based monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that operates in real time, in small and large indoor and outdoor environments. The system is robust to severe motion clutter, allows wide baseline loop closing and relocalization, and includes full automatic initialization. Building on excellent algorithms of recent years, we designed from scratch a novel system that uses the same features for all SLAM tasks: tracking, mapping, relocalization, and loop closing. A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation. We present an exhaustive evaluation in 27 sequences from the most popular datasets. ORB-SLAM achieves unprecedented performance with respect to other state-of-the-art monocular SLAM approaches. For the benefit of the community, we make the source code public.},

Intentional or unintentional jamming makes GPS unreliable as the only source of information and an additional independent supporting navigation system should be used.

Island landmarks in the radar scans are tracked between multiple scans using visual features. This provides information not only about the position of the vessel but also of its course and velocity. We present here a navigation framework that requires no additional hardware than the already existing naval radar sensor.

We pursue an active perception strategy that enables MAVs with limited onboard sensing and processing capabilities to concurrently assess feasible rooftop landing sites with a vision-based perception system while generating trajectories that balance continued landing site assessment and the requirement to provide visual monitoring of an interest point. The contributions of the work are twofold: (1) a perception system that employs a dense motion stereo approach that determines the 3D model of the captured scene without the need of geo-referenced images, scene geometry constraints, or external navigation aids; and (2) an online trajectory generation approach that balances the need to concurrently explore available rooftop vantages of an interest point while ensuring confidence in the landing site suitability by considering the impact of landing site uncertainty as assessed by the perception system. Simulation and experimental evaluation of the performance of the perception and trajectory generation methodologies are analyzed independently and jointly in order to establish the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.},

Then, a robust total least squares method (RTLS) is introduced into the KF, and a robust total Kalman filter (RTKF) algorithm is derived. The RTKF is a simple, flexible and effective algorithm. It is simple because its computational formulae are similar to the computational formulae of a standard KF; it is flexible because it can be used in a wide range of applications; it is effective because the influence of outliers on estimated results is weakened. Finally, the simulated example of the indoor location and the empirical example of pseudorange differential positioning are used to demonstrate the performance of the RTKF algorithm. The results prove the validity, robustness, and reliability of the RTKF in dealing with the outliers that exist in both observation vector and design matrix of the EIV model. Furthermore, the results of the empirical example show that the RTKF improves the precision of a pseudorange differential positioning compared with KF and robust Kalman filter (RKF) algorithms regardless the observation model has outliers or not in this empirical example.},

Because of its advantages in terms of robustness, VI-SLAM enjoys wide applications in the field of localization and mapping, including in mobile robotics, self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous underwater vehicles. This study provides a comprehensive survey on VI-SLAM. Following a short introduction, this study is the first to review VI-SLAM techniques from filtering-based and optimization-based perspectives. It summarizes state-of-the-art studies over the last 10 years based on the back-end approach, camera type, and sensor fusion type. Key VI-SLAM technologies are also introduced such as feature extraction and tracking, core theory, and loop closure. The performance of representative VI-SLAM methods and famous VI-SLAM datasets are also surveyed. Finally, this study contributes to the comparison of filtering-based and optimization-based methods through experiments. A comparative study of VI-SLAM methods helps understand the differences in their operating principles. Optimization-based methods achieve excellent localization accuracy and lower memory utilization, while filtering-based methods have advantages in terms of computing resources. Furthermore, this study proposes future development trends and research directions for VI-SLAM. It provides a detailed survey of VI-SLAM techniques and can serve as a brief guide to newcomers in the field of SLAM and experienced researchers looking for possible directions for future work.},

Each sensor node in the network represents the terrain using a Gaussian mixture to represent the elevation density in each grid cell. The local sensor node uses a rigorous probabilistic analysis of sensor measurement errors to associate individual measurements with multiple grid cells to account for in-plane uncertainty. Representing the elevation density in each grid cell as a sum of Gaussian distributions leads to a convenient channel filter implementation for distributed data fusion. The new information exchanged between nodes is assimilated locally to generate a global terrain height estimate on each sensor node. The distributed terrain height algorithm is demonstrated in a laboratory test environment using data from three sensor nodes over a 60 second data collection. The distributed terrain height algorithm is shown to perform equivalent to the centralized case even in the presence of communication failures. {\textcopyright}2009 ISIF.},

The goal is to find a trajectory that maximizes an information quality metric (e.g. variance reduction, information gain, or mutual information) and also falls within a pre-specified budget constraint (e.g. fuel, energy, or time). Prior algorithms have employed combinatorial optimization techniques to solve these problems, but existing techniques are typically restricted to discrete domains and often scale poorly in the size of the problem. Our proposed rapidly exploring information gathering (RIG) algorithms combine ideas from sampling-based motion planning with branch and bound techniques to achieve efficient information gathering in continuous space with motion constraints. We provide analysis of the asymptotic optimality of our algorithms, and we present several conservative pruning strategies for modular, submodular, and time-varying information objectives. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques find optimal solutions more quickly than existing combinatorial solvers, and we provide a proof-of-concept field implementation on an autonomous surface vehicle performing a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake.},

The IGM steering commands null the difference between the state variable and the targeted end conditions within 75 lb of the calculus of variations optimum. Mathematical models and updating procedures are developed for orbital navigation to provide sufficient accuracy in predicting re-ignition after two to three orbits. The lunar conic is targeted at re-ignition as functions of launch time and lunar geometry. Orbital navigation is required on the lunar trajectory until the docking phase is completed. Navigation and targeting approximations require midcourse corrections of less than one half of those contributed by the platform hardware errors.

abstract = {Decentralized visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a powerful tool for multi-robot applications in environments where absolute positioning is not available. Being visual, it relies on cheap, lightweight and versatile cameras, and, being decentralized, it does not rely on communication to a central entity. In this work, we integrate state-of-the-art decentralized SLAM components into a new, complete decentralized visual SLAM system. To allow for data association and optimization, existing decentralized visual SLAM systems exchange the full map data among all robots, incurring large data transfers at a complexity that scales quadratically with the robot count. In contrast, our method performs efficient data association in two stages: first, a compact full-image descriptor is deterministically sent to only one robot. Then, only if the first stage succeeded, the data required for relative pose estimation is sent, again to only one robot. Thus, data association scales linearly with the robot count and uses highly compact place representations. For optimization, a state-of-the-art decentralized pose-graph optimization method is used. It exchanges a minimum amount of data which is linear with trajectory overlap. We characterize the resulting system and identify bottlenecks in its components. The system is evaluated on publicly available datasets and we provide open access to the code. Supplementary Material Data and code are at: https://github.com/uzh-rpg/dslam-open.},

abstract = {Small scale terrain hazards, such as rocks, slopes, and craters, can pose significant risk to landing spacecraft and rover or payload deployment. Onboard Hazard Detection and Avoidance (HDA) systems scan and analyze the landing area for these hazards in real time during descent, and divert the spacecraft to the safest touchdown site. The computationally efficient Simple Safe Site Selection (S4) algorithm combined with a ash LIDAR is an HDA system geared towards small robotic spacecraft. Rather than creating and analyzing a digital elevation map (DEM) from potentially many overlapping range images, S4 operates directly on a single ash LIDAR image. Extending prior work that has analyzed S4 performance for Mars landing using extensive simulations, this paper evaluates S4 performance using actual ash LIDAR images of an artificial hazard field acquired during a 2014 helicopter field test in Death Valley, CA. In particular, we describe LIDAR characterization and calibration, creation of ground truth elevation and safety maps, creation of ground truth sensor poses, actual S4 algorithm processing, and performance analysis. The results show that the safety cost images produced by S4 are remarkably close to the ground truth safety map (computed offline by an HDA algorithm developed under the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance (ALHAT) project) at significantly reduced computational cost, confirming S4 as a viable candidate algorithm for onboard spacecraft HDA.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} VDE VERLAG GMBH {\textperiodcentered} Berlin {\textperiodcentered} Offenbach This paper presents a novel framework for incorporating semantic information in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework based on LIDAR and camera to improve navigation accuracy and alleviate drifts caused by translation and rotation errors. Specifically, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a camera and LIDAR, operating in an indoor environment is considered. The proposed method uses features extracted from a camera and its correspondences in the LIDAR depth map to obtain the pose relative to a keyframe which is refined by semantic features obtained from a deep neural network. Additionally, each point in the map is associated with a semantic label to perform semantically guided local and global pose optimization. Since semantically correlated features can be expected to have higher likelihood of correct data association, the proposed coupling of semantic labeling and SLAM provides better robustness and accuracy. We demonstrate our approach using an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) operating in an indoor environment equipped with a camera and a LIDAR.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 SPIE. This paper presents a comparison of four most recent ROS-based monocular SLAM-related methods: ORB-SLAM, REMODE, LSD-SLAM, and DPPTAM, and analyzes their feasibility for a mobile robot application in indoor environment. We tested these methods using video data that was recorded from a conventional wide-angle full HD webcam with a rolling shutter. The camera was mounted on a human-operated prototype of an unmanned ground vehicle, which followed a closed-loop trajectory. Both feature-based methods (ORB-SLAM, REMODE) and direct SLAMrelated algorithms (LSD-SLAM, DPPTAM) demonstrated reasonably good results in detection of volumetric objects, corners, obstacles and other local features. However, we met difficulties with recovering typical for offices homogeneously colored walls, since all of these methods created empty spaces in a reconstructed sparse 3D scene. This may cause collisions of an autonomously guided robot with unfeatured walls and thus limits applicability of maps, which are obtained by the considered monocular SLAM-related methods for indoor robot navigation.},

The method is extensively evaluated in long duration simulations on an embedded PC and deployed to an aerial robot equipped with a 3D LiDAR. The result is significant memory efficiency as compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {To increase the science return of future missions to Mars and to enable sample return missions, the accuracy with which a lander can be delivered to the Martian surface must be improved by orders of magnitude. The prior work developed a convex-optimization-based minimum-fuel powered-descent guidance algorithm. In this paper, this convex-optimization-based approach is extended to handle the case when no feasible trajectory to the target exists. In this case, the objective is to generate the minimum-landing-error trajectory, which is the trajectory that minimizes the distance to the prescribed target while using the available fuel optimally. This problem is inherently a nonconvex optimal control problem due to a nonzero lower bound on the magnitude of the feasible thrust vector. It is first proven that an optimal solution of a convex relaxation of the problem is also optimal for the original nonconvex problem, which is referred to as a lossless convexification of the original nonconvex problem. Then it is shown that the minimum-landing-error trajectory generation problem can be posed as a convex optimization problem and solved to global optimality with known bounds on convergence time. This makes the approach amenable to onboard implementation for real-time applications.},

abstract = {Real time trajectory optimization of the powered descent phase in Mars pinpoint landing is presented in this paper. The optimal soft landing trajectory in the presence of large initial condition dispersion and inequality constraints on thrust, orientation and path is generated in real time. The guidance algorithm proposed in this paper can converge from a wide range of initial conditions within the capability of the propulsion system (propellant available and thrust). A two level optimization scheme is adopted for solving the trajectory parameters and optimizing fuel consumption. In the outer loop, the required burn duration is iterated using a simple optimization procedure for minimizing fuel consumption. In the inner loop, the trajectory for a given burn time obtained from the outer loop, is solved using a modified Newton-Raphson scheme in the pseudo-spectral global collocation framework. An important advantage of this scheme is that, it does not use any general gradient-based optimization procedures which are time consuming. This makes it attractive for on-board implementation. The algorithm is least sensitive to initial guess values while exhibiting very good convergence properties. The computation cost for solving the trajectory equations is also minimal in terms of optimization time. It is tested for robustness with respect to both initial guess and initial condition dispersion in the Monte Carlo sense.},

The main component of this architecture, NetVLAD, is a new generalized VLAD layer, inspired by the 'Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors' image representation commonly used in image retrieval. The layer is readily pluggable into any CNN architecture and amenable to training via backpropagation. Second, we create a new weakly supervised ranking loss, which enables end-to-end learning of the architecture's parameters from images depicting the same places over time downloaded from Google Street View Time Machine. Third, we develop an efficient training procedure which can be applied on very large-scale weakly labelled tasks. Finally, we show that the proposed architecture and training procedure significantly outperform non-learnt image representations and off-the-shelf CNN descriptors on challenging place recognition and image retrieval benchmarks.},

It shows that the algorithm degenerates with time, regardless of the number of particles used or the density of landmarks within the environment, and will always produce optimistic estimates of uncertainty in the long-term. In essence, FastSLAM behaves like a non-optimal local search algorithm; in the short-term it may produce consistent uncertainty estimates but, in the long-term, it is unable to adequately explore the state-space to be a reasonable Bayesian estimator. However, the number of particles and landmarks does affect the accuracy of the estimated mean and, given sufficient particles, FastSLAM can produce good non-stochastic estimates in practice. FastSLAM also has several practical advantages, particularly with regard to data association, and will probably work well in combination with other versions of stochastic SLAM, such as EKF-based SLAM. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Optimal data fusion then should model the system state as a positive random variable, which has a probability density function that is restricted to the positive real axis. However, classical approaches based on normal densities fail here, in particular whenever the variance of the likelihood is rather large compared to the mean. In this paper, it is considered to model such random parameters with a Gamma distribution, since its support is positive and it is the maximum entropy distribution for such variables. For a Bayesian recursion, an approximative moment matching approach is proposed.

abstract = {Landing safety is the prior concern in planetary exploration missions. With the development of precise landing technology, future missions require vehicles to land on places of great scientific interest which are usually surrounded by rocks and craters. In order to perform a safe landing, the vehicle should be capable of detecting hazards, estimating its fuel consumption as well as touchdown performance, and locating a safe spot to land. The landing site selection process can be treated as an optimization problem which, however, cannot be efficiently solved through traditional optimization methods due to its complexity. Hence, the paper proposes a synthetic landing area assessment criterion, safety index, as a solution of the problem, which selects the best landing site by assessing terrain safety, fuel consumption and touchdown performance during descent. The computation effort is cut down after reducing the selection scope and the optimal landing site is found through a quick one-dimensional search. A typical example based on the Mars Science Laboratory mission is simulated to demonstrate the capability of the method. It is proved that the proposed strategy manages to pick out a safe landing site for the mission effectively. The safety index can be applied in various planetary descent phases and provides reference for future mission designs.},

Exploitation of all possible image information leads to more accurate estimates and avoids the inherent difficulties of reliably associating features. We also show here that, in this case, structural constraints can be enforced within the procedure as well (instead of a posteriori), namely the cheirality, the rigidity, and those related to the lighting variations. We formulate the visual SLAM problem as a nonlinear image alignment task. The proposed parameters to perform this task are optimally computed by an efficient second-order approximation method for fast processing and avoidance of irrelevant minima. Furthermore, a new solution to the visual SLAM initialization problem is described whereby no assumptions are made about either the scene or the camera motion.

Our approach utilizes the so-called SIFT algorithm by which distinctive features are extracted from both aerial images and LiDAR intensity data. The extracted features are then automatically matched and the aerial image and LiDAR intensity data are registered in the subsequent stage. The invariance of the SIFT features to image scale and rotation and the robustness of the features with respect to changes in illumination, noise and to some extend changes in viewpoint may qualify those features particularly for our purpose. For SIFT feature extraction an open MATLAB implementation is used and integrated in the overall image registration process.

The majority of occupancy mapping approaches enforce an a priori discretization on the environment, resulting in a fixed resolution map that limits the expressiveness of the representation. The proposed approach removes this a priori discretization, learns continuous representations for the evidence of occupied and free space to derive the probability of occupancy, and enables occupancy grid maps to be generated at arbitrary resolution. Efficient methods are also presented that accurately evaluate the probability of occupancy in individual cells and enable multiresolution mapping and local occupancy evaluation. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by comparison to state-of-the-art discrete and continuous mapping techniques in both two dimensions and three dimensions. The core contribution of this work is a memory-efficient method for deriving occupancy that is amenable to small or large corrections in pose without the need to regenerate the entire map. The applications under considerations are low-bandwidth scenarios (e.g., multi-robot exploration) and operations in expansive environments, where storing an occupancy grid map of the entire environment would be prohibitive.},

@article{Szmuk2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved. In this paper we present a convex programming approach for a fuel-optimal powered landing problem in the presence of aerodynamic drag forces and new types of non-convex control constraints . This problem presents a challenge for real-time guidance applications due to its non-convex control constraints, and nonlinearities introduced by drag, massdepletion dynamics, and free final time. To make the problem tractable, we employ lossless convexification to address the minimum-thrust constraint, and successive convexification to eliminate the remaining non-convexities. The latter constitutes the main contribution of this paper, and relies on the use of linearization, trust regions, and relaxations to formulate the problem as a sequence of iteratively solved second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems. In this form, we are able to implement our algorithm using powerful Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers, ideal for use in real-time applications. Furthermore, the only initialization parameter our algorithm requires is a coarse guess of the time of flight. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed successive convexification algorithm converges reliably after only a small number of successive convexification iterations. Additionally, we show that the algorithm is robust to a wide range of time of flight inputs, thus making it suitable for autonomous real-time applications.},

abstract = {Normal mixture models are widely used for statistical modeling of data, including cluster analysis. However maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for normal mixtures using the EM algorithm may fail as the result of singularities or degeneracies. To avoid this, we propose replacing the MLE by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator, also found by the EM algorithm. For choosing the number of components and the model parameterization, we propose a modified version of BIC, where the likelihood is evaluated at the MAP instead of the MLE. We use a highly dispersed proper conjugate prior, containing a small fraction of one observation's worth of information. The resulting method avoids degeneracies and singularities, but when these are not present it gives similar results to the standard method using MLE, EM and BIC. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science + Business Media Inc.},

abstract = {Fast pattern detection and identification is fundamental problem for many applications of real-time vision systems. The desirable characteristics for a solution are that it requires little computation, localizes a pattern robustly and with high accuracy, and can identify a large number of unique pattern identifiers so that many of these markers can be tracked within a field a view. We will present a system that can accurately track a broad class of patterns both accurately and quickly, when used with a suitable low level vision system that can return calibrated coordinates of regions in an image. Both pattern design and the detection algorithm are considered together to find a solution meeting the above criteria. Along the way, assumptions are verified to make informed choices without relying on guesswork, and allowing similar system to be designed on a solid experimental and statistical basis.},

abstract = {Structured environment can be modelled in a simplified way as a set of planar surfaces and lines. For mobile robot equipped with a 3D sensor and a camera, the incremental construction of such a model is a Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) problem: while exploring the environment, the robot executes motions; from each position, it acquires sensory data, extracts 3D perceptual features, and simultaneously, performs self-localisation and model update. Our robot JIDO has a 3D pivoting laser range finder, acquiring images of 3D points, and has a camera. Firstly, a segmentation algorithm of a 3D image into a set of planar faces is described: this algorithm uses a region growing strategy and the Extended Kalman Filtering to estimate the parameters of the support plane of every face. These planar faces are used as landmarks. Next, we describe how to extract 2D line landmarks by fusing data from both sensors. Our stochastic map is of heterogeneous type and contains plane and 2D line landmarks. At first, The SLAM formalism is used to build a stochastic planar map, and results on the incremental construction of such a map are presented, further on, heterogeneous map will be constructed.},

The elevation map is continuously updated at a rate of 1 Hz with depth maps that are triangulated from multiple views using recursive Bayesian estimation. To highlight the usefulness of the proposed mapping framework for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles, we successfully demonstrate fully autonomous landing including landing-spot detection in real-world experiments.},

@article{Strasdat2010,
abstract = {While the most accurate solution to off-line structure from motion (SFM) problems is undoubtedly to extract as much correspondence information as possible and perform global optimisation, sequential methods suitable for live video streams must approximate this to fit within fixed computational bounds. Two quite different approaches to real-time SFM - also called monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) - have proven successful, but they sparsify the problem in different ways. Filtering methods marginalise out past poses and summarise the information gained over time with a probability distribution. Keyframe methods retain the optimisation approach of global bundle adjustment, but computationally must select only a small number of past frames to process. In this paper we perform the first rigorous analysis of the relative advantages of filtering and sparse optimisation for sequential monocular SLAM. A series of experiments in simulation as well using a real image SLAM system were performed by means of covariance propagation and Monte Carlo methods, and comparisons made using a combined cost/accuracy measure. With some well-discussed reservations, we conclude that while filtering may have a niche in systems with low processing resources, in most modern applications keyframe optimisation gives the most accuracy per unit of computing time.},

abstract = {This paper presents a data fusion algorithm, using an Adaptive Extended Kalman filter (AFK) for estimation of velocity and position of a UAV. A LIDAR sensor provides local position updates using a SLAM technique, a GPS provides corrections when available and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) is used as an additional input to the Extended Kalman filter. We adapt the measurement noise covariance (R) of the AKF based on both the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver error as well as on the LiDAR point cloud point-to-point match error. A simulation environment was developed to test the proposed SLAM as well as navigation (e.g., autopilot) algorithms in a virtual, but accurate environment. We show that by adapting the measurement noise covariance (R) of the AKF we improve both the accuracy and reliability of the position estimate, specially in areas with GPS signal drop outs such as urban canyon environments. {\textcopyright} 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.
